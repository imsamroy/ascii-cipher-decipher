Cipher a message to ASCII and then decipher it  

This is just a simple C++ project I made as a hobby.

# Running the project on GNU/Linux distributions

![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/imsamroy/ascii-cipher-decipher)

- Go to the releases page (https://github.com/imsamroy/ascii-cipher-decipher/releases)  

- Download the "Linux-cipher" and "Linux-decipher" files  

- Then open a terminal in the directory where you have kept them and run `./Linux-cipher` to cipher and `./Linux-decipher` to decipher  

**NOTE: Right click the files and go to properties then permissions and make sure that they are allowed to run as programs**

# Running the project on Windows

![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/imsamroy/ascii-cipher-decipher)

- Go to the releases page (https://github.com/imsamroy/ascii-cipher-decipher/releases)  

- Download the "Windows-cipher" and "Windows-decipher" exe files  

- Then run the first one to cipher and second one to decipher  

**NOTE: If you get a message like: "Windows Protected your PC" then ignore it and click the Run anyway option (Any exe not recognised by the Microsoft database gets that message even if it is not suspicious, you can search about it online if you want to)**
