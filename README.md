# ASCII Cipher Decipher
Cipher a message to ASCII and then decipher it  
If you do not have a C++ compiler setup on your system then follow the steps: (The steps will be about the GCC compiler)

# C++ Setup for GNU/Linux distributions
The GCC compiler is normally installed by default in most distributions. You can check by-
```gcc -version``` or ```gcc -v``` If it is not installed then:  
Ubuntu/Debian- ```sudo apt install build-essential```  
Arch/Manjaro- ```sudo pacman -S gcc```  
Red Hat- ```sudo yum groupinstall 'Development Tools'```  
Fedora- ```sudo dnf groupinstall 'Development Tools'```  

# C++ Setup for Windows
Setup the MinGW compiler with instructions from any of these or find some other guide :)

# C++ Setup for Mac
Download the GCC compiler for Mac- ```xcode-select --install```

# Running the project on GNU/Linux distributions
Go to the releases page (https://github.com/imsamroy/ascii-cipher-decipher/releases)  
Download the "Linux Cipher" and "Linux Decipher" files  
Then run the former to cipher and the latter to decipher

# Running the project on Windows
Go to the releases page (https://github.com/imsamroy/ascii-cipher-decipher/releases)  
Download the "Windows Cipher" and "Windows Decipher" exe files  
Then run the former to cipher and latter to decipher  
**NOTE: If you get a message like: "Windows Protected your PC" then ignore it and click the Run anyway option**
