Cipher a message in ASCII and then decipher it  

This is just a simple C++ project I made as a hobby.

# Running the project on GNU/Linux distributions

![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/imsamroy/ascii-cipher-decipher)

- Go to the releases page (https://github.com/imsamroy/ascii-cipher-decipher/releases)  

- Download the **"Linux-ASCII-Cipher-Decipher.zip"** file and then extract it as a folder.  

- Then open a terminal inside the extracted folder and run `./Linux-cipher` to cipher and `./Linux-decipher` to decipher.  

**NOTE: Before running the executables, right click the files and go to properties then permissions and make sure that they are allowed to run as programs**

# Running the project on Windows

![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/imsamroy/ascii-cipher-decipher)

- Go to the releases page (https://github.com/imsamroy/ascii-cipher-decipher/releases)  

- Download the **"Windows-ASCII-Cipher-Decipher.zip"** file and extract it as a folder.  

- Then inside the extracted folder, run **"Windows-cipher.exe"** to cipher and **"Windows-decipher.exe"** to decipher.  

**NOTE: If you get a message like: "Windows Protected your PC" then ignore it and click "More info" then click the Run anyway option (Any exe not recognised by the Microsoft database gets that message even if it is not suspicious, you can search about it online if you want to)**
